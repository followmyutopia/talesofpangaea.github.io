<h1>Tales of Pangaea</h1>
<p>Tales of Pangaea is a computer game made by an independent developer team from Russia, called 
<a href="https://apepehalab.github.io/">Apepeha Lab</a>. It is planned to be an online role-play game.<br>
<br>
At this moment, the game is under active development by our team. We are not sponsored by anyone 
and developing the game in our free from work time, which makes it a bit slower than commercial 
companies, we apologize for that, and hope you understand that indie games are made a bit 
more slowly. After all, you can always <a href="https://www.tinkoff.ru/sl/7om9j60P6iP">support our project</a> to make it faster.<br>
<br>
This site is also under development, it is more a draft than actually a site, but we hope even 
at this stage it could be informative.<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
Apepeha Lab team</p>

<section id="lore" style="display: none;">
<h1>Lore</h1>
<p>Tales of Pangaea's plot will take place on an ancient continent Pangaea. This term was 
suggested by Alfred Lothar Wegener and means "the All-Earth". As it's the single continent 
(well, except islands) in the current version of the game, this name suits it perfectly.</p>
</section>

<section id="races" style="display: none;">
<h1>Races</h1>
<p>There are six Races in Tales of Pangaea:</p>
<article>
  <h2>Humans</h2>
  <p>The brave people of Pangaea trusted no one and were in a constant war with savage trolls of the south and selfish elves of the west. 
  Frederick, the king of Wittenum, ordered that every man of his kingdom should be taught fencing since youth. Women of Pangaea were also 
  great warriors, but also nice tailors and farmers. They were teaching kids to learn a lot from them.</p>
  <p>Not all the humans were devoted to war. Curiosity made a young orphan Avicus to find a strange meteorite that gave him uncontrolled 
  magic, and he devoted his life to learning how to control it along with his disciples Efim and Panamar. They founded the castle of 
  Argenthold at the north of the dark and dangerous forest Noxxvald, and started teaching others magic.</p>

  <h2>Dwarves</h2>

  <h2>Orcs</h2>

  <h2>Trolls</h2>
  <p>The tribe of savage Trolls of Rakhshar-mar, was the oldest race of Pangaea. Tall, gray-skinned, tatooed, and fanged, they lived in 
  small villages and were afraid to communicate with other races and creatures. They devoted their life to keeping old traditions, 
  habits and knowledge. They were mostly sorcerers and alchemist, they knew everything about herbs, poisons, and amulets.</p>
  <p>The trolls praised their only goddess Rakhshar. Her skin was black as night, she had multiple hands and could not control her anger.
  A long story lies beneath the goddess of trolls and you will learn it through the story of the game.</p>

<section id="donate" style="display: none;">
<h1>Support our project</h1>
<p>As we told you before, we are an independent and not sponsored group of game developers. We 
develop Tales of Pangaea at free from work time and on the computers we have. The director 
of the Apepeha Lab project uses his computer with Intel Celeron 1.6GHz processor, 4 GBs of 
RAM and integrated video card. So, you can imagine that some operations take a decent time, 
slowing the development in common.<br>
<br>
That is why our team will be glad if you donate any amount of money to the project.<br>
