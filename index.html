<h1>Tales of Pangaea</h1>
<p>Tales of Pangaea is a computer game made by an independent developer team from Russia, called 
<a href="https://apepehalab.github.io/">Apepeha Lab</a>. It is planned to be an online role-play game.<br>
<br>
At this moment, the game is under active development by our team. We are not sponsored by anyone 
and developing the game in our free from work time, which makes it a bit slower than commercial 
companies, we apologize for that, and hope you understand that indie games are made a bit 
more slowly. After all, you can always <a href="https://www.tinkoff.ru/sl/7om9j60P6iP">support our project</a> to make it faster.<br>
<br>
This site is also under development, it is more a draft than actually a site, but we hope even 
at this stage it could be informative.<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
Apepeha Lab team</p>

<section id="lore" style="display: none;">
<h1>Lore</h1>
<p>Tales of Pangaea's plot will take place on an ancient continent Pangaea. This term was 
suggested by Alfred Lothar Wegener and means "the All-Earth". As it's the single continent 
(well, except islands) in the current version of the game, this name suits it perfectly.</p>
</section>

<section id="races" style="display: none;">
<h1>Races</h1>
<p>There are six Races in Tales of Pangaea:</p>
<article>
  <h2>Humans</h2>
  <p>The brave people of Pangaea trusted no one and were in a constant war with savage trolls of the south and selfish elves of the west. 
  Frederick, the king of Wittenum, ordered that every man of his kingdom should be taught fencing since youth. Women of Pangaea were also 
  great warriors, but also nice tailors and farmers. They were teaching kids to learn a lot from them.</p>
  <p>Not all the humans were devoted to war. Curiosity made a young orphan Avicus to find a strange meteorite that gave him uncontrolled 
  magic, and he devoted his life to learning how to control it along with his disciples Efim and Panamar. They founded the castle of 
  Argenthold at the north of the dark and dangerous forest Noxxvald, and started teaching others magic.</p>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>Elves</h2>
  <p>The elves of Evindale live in tropics by the gult in the middle of the continent. They are a selfish race that cares for money and 
  precious metals and gems, they buy Dwarvish goods and resell them to the other kingdoms. They are good archers and jewelcrafters.
  </p>
  <p>Since magic was discovered on Pangaea, the elvish Solaril became very curious about it. First he sneakily travelled to Argenthold to 
    find out what the magic is, and when he managed to control it himself, he started sending the elves of Pangaea to learn and spread 
    the knowledge among his race.
  </p>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>Dwarves</h2>
  <p>In the middle of Pangaea, there is a remarkable massive mountain, called Esgaar. Everyone knows about the treasures of this mountain, 
  and everyone wants to loot it. But the way to the mountain is tricky, it lays through the dark forest Noxxvald which is full of evil, 
  you need to be sneaky and silend to go through it. And the few who can make the path through the forest, mostly get killed by the race 
  of Dwarves.</p>
  <p>Dwarves are hidy. They built their home inside Esgaar and devoted their life into mining metals, gold and stones. Due to this work 
  they became short and usually covered with stone dust, that's why they become hard to notice. And they used this as the cover, they hide 
  when someone else comes to Esgaar and attack suddenly.</p>
  <p>They make good armor and weapons, they make beautiful necklaces and rings. And they have a lot of bargainers who sneakily travels to 
  other kingdoms, mostly elves to sell goods and make others envy. So, the goods of Dwarfes became very famous among everyone.</p>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>Orcs</h2>
  <p>This is the most unlearned race of Pangaea. Very few players saw Orcs in real life, most of humans, dwarves and elves don't even 
    believe that they exist. They say, Orcs live on the very west of the continent, on the other side of the mountains. Bards describe 
    Orcs as a barbarians in leather armor that live in holes under the ground and can control animals, some say they can even 
    transform into rhinos to defend their lands. But Orcs never came in contact with other races.</p>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>Trolls</h2>
  <p>The tribe of savage Trolls of Rakhshar-mar, was the oldest race of Pangaea. Tall, gray-skinned, tatooed, and fanged, they lived in 
  small villages and were afraid to communicate with other races and creatures. They devoted their life to keeping old traditions, 
  habits and knowledge. They were mostly sorcerers and alchemist, they knew everything about herbs, poisons, and amulets.</p>
  <p>The trolls praised their only goddess Rakhshar. Her skin was black as night, she had multiple hands and could not control her anger.
  A long story lies beneath the goddess of trolls and you will learn it through the story of the game.</p>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>Undeads</h2>
  <p>Every race of Pangaea was always afraid of the Noxxvald forest. This place was dark and mysterious, and people was talking about evil
  creatures in it. There are a lot of tales about the spirit of the Swamps, called Merech, who kills everyone who walks into the forest.</p>
  <p>But this is not the only danger of Noxxvald. Deep in the shadows, there hide undeads, sneaky Necromancers, that once were humans. 
  Their will to beat death had lead them into being abandoned and feared, their way of making new undeads made everyone avoid even walking by 
  the dark forest, and only crazy beings can make their path through the forest. You will learn the dark story of undeads through
  the game quests.</p>
